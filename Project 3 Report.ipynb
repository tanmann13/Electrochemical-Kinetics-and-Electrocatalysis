    "## Introduction\n",
    "Both thermodynamics and kinetics play important roles in determining rates and potentials required to induce electron transfer reaction. Many of the reactions that have practical use to electrochemical engineers pursuing improved clean energy technologies, entail multi-step electron-transfer processes. For example, electrochemical water splitting involves a four-electron transfer for the anodic oxidation reaction and a two-electron transfer process for the cathodic reduction reaction.<cite id=\"vwe6l\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2F23QJR3YX\"><sup>1</sup></a></cite> This makes the kinetics for the electrochemical reaction slow, requiring large overpotentials before the activation barrier for the reaction is overcome. While the thermodynamic description of water splitting suggests potentials of 1.23 V vs NHE will drive the reaction, a potential of 1.8 V vs NHE is often required.<cite id=\"0tisc\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FFJXNNLJZ\"><sup>2</sup></a></cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "Water splitting consists of two half reactions occurring at the cathode and anode: the production of H<sub>2</sub> at the cathode, also known as hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), and the production of O<sub>2</sub> at the anode, also known as oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Depending on the medium, the equilibrium potential for the reaction, E<sub>eq</sub> is subject to change. In an acid medium with H<sup>+</sup> at unit activity, the half reactions are given by equations 1 & 2 below. \n",

    "The efficiency of HER and OER are highly dependent upon the active catalyst or electrode driving the reaction. Pt is one of most widely used and most efficient catalysts for driving HER. Platinum black was used more frequently as a catalyst in the 1950s and 1960s for both acid and alkaline fuel cells, due to it's high surface area, although since then platinum metal dispersed on a carbon support (Pt/C) has been the more popular choice due to improvements in efficiency.<cite id=\"yfmty\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FUAWXUCDV\"><sup>3</sup></a></cite> Cu has been studied as an electrocatalyst for HER, with results showing relatively poor catalytic performance compared to the alternatives, however there is ongoing research on how it's catalytic efficiency may be improved.<cite id=\"0hq5c\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FNKBKB4K6\"><sup>4</sup></a></cite>\n",

    "## 2 Experimental\n",
    "### 2.1 Electrocatalysis for HER\n",
    "Three different working electrodes were used for the HER experiment. A copper electrode was prepared by sealing a thin piece of copper wire in a 6 mm borosilicate glass tube. Hot glue was used to seal the end of the tube and prevent leaking. A Pt electrode was using before and after being coated with platinum black (PtCl<sub>6</sub>). The platinum black coating was applied using a solution containing 10 mL of DI H<sub>2</sub>O, 100 mg of H<sub>2</sub>PtCl<sub>6</sub>, and 2 mg of PbNO<sub>3</sub>. A potential bias of -2.0 V was applied for 3 minutes to the Pt working electrode in a two electrode cell, with a separate platinum counter electrode. The Pt-black electrode was then rinsed with DI water and dried with N<sub>2</sub>. \n",
    "\n",
    "The experiments were conducted in a three-neck flask using 1.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> as the electrolyte. A poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) stir bar was used to ensure H<sub>2</sub> bubbles were quickly removed from the surface of the working electrode. The electrolyte was purged with N<sub>2</sub> for 10 minutes prior to any experiments. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used, in addition to a Pt counter electrode. To clean the Pt working electrode, a current bias of &pm;5 mA was applied to the working electrode, alternating every 1 s.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first set of experiments utilized the clean Pt working electrode. A CV experiment was conducted at three different scan rates between 20 and 200 mV/s without stirring. The potential was swept between -0.2 V vs Ag/AgCl and 1.0 V vs Ag/AgCl. The area of the H<sub>I</sub> and H<sub>II</sub> adsorption peaks were integrated to determine the microscopic surface area of the Pt working electrode. This procedure was replicated with the Pt-black working electrode as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution resistance, $R_s$ was obtained using an electrical impedance spectroscopy experimental technique (EIS). The mean potential was set to 0 V vs Ag/AgCl, and the frequency was swept from 1 MHz to 100 Hz. The solution resistance was taken as the first intercept with the x-axis of the Nyquist plot(the real impedance axis).<cite id=\"bzkgo\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FQ9S7B3PQ\"><sup>10</sup></a></cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "The HER kinetics were measured with CV experiments. The potential was swept between -0.5 V and 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl at a scan rate of 10 mV/s, while the stir bar was rotating at it's fastest available rotation rate. The collected CV curves were corrected for ohmic losses, where $ E = E_{measured} - iR_s$. This experiment was performed on the Pt-black and copper working electrodes in an identical manner. Tafel analysis was conducted to determine the exchange current density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Electrocatalysis for OER\n",
    "\n",
    "A pre-constructed working electrode for the OER experiments was prepared by electrodeposition of an Fe-NiOOH catalyst layer. The working electrode itself consisted of a glass slide that had been plated with 25 nm of Ti, and 75 nm of Au through a thermal evaporation process. This glass slide was then electrically wired to a lead connecting to the potentiostat. The edges of the slide and metal layers were encapsulated with hot glue and attached to a glass tube, also covered in hot glue to prevent any incompatibilities with the highly basic electrolyte. The full procedure for constructing the working electrode is detailed by Stevens et. al.<cite id=\"xgr5c\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FZA3KF2R3\"><sup>9</sup></a></cite> The microscopic surface area of this working electrode was provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "The catalyst film was electrodeposited onto the working electrode by applying a current bias of 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 s in a two-electrode cell with a silver wire as a counter electrode. The cell electrolyte contained 0.10 M Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> and 0.003 M FeCl<sub>2</sub>.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Nalgene<sup>TM</sup> polymer jar-cell filled with 1.0 M KOH was used for the OER experiments. An Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used, with a Pt wire serving as the counter electrode. An EIS experiment was performed to determine the solution resistance as described above for the HER kinetics experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OER kinetics were characterized using CV experiments. The potential was swept between -0.1 V and 0.7 V vs Ag/AgCl, at scan rates of 20 and 50 mV/s. The number of electrochemically active catalyst sites was measured by integrating the cathodic Ni redox wave. The collected CVs were corrected for ohmic losses in manner similar to that described above for the HER kinetics experiments.\n"

    "### 4.1 HER\n",
    "##### Area Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pt-black electrode displayed a much larger area than the Pt electrode, at 0.123 cm<sup>2</sup> compared to 0.565 cm<sup>2</sup>. The geometric area of the Pt electrode is 0.0314 cm<sup>2</sup>. The roughness factor is taken as $\\rho = A_{micro}/A_{geo}$. The roughness factor of the Pt electrode would then be 3.915, and the roughness factor of the Pt-black electrode would be 17.98.  This result expected, as the Pt-black catalytic coating is not a polished metal surface, but rather a dispersion of nano-particles adhered to the electrode surface.<cite id=\"lm368\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FUAWXUCDV\"><sup>3</sup></a></cite> The relatively high roughness factor for the Pt electrode is due to micro scratches or other defects not removed from polishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of the area measurement CV experiments were performed after the cell had been purged with N<sub>2</sub>, and the potentials used for the sweeps were chosen with the intention of maximizing the potentials swept while not allowing HER to occur. It is important to ensure that the cell is purged of oxygen and replaced with an inert gas because dissolved O<sub>2</sub> can cause a shift in your current from being reduced to H<sub>2</sub>O. This can therefore affect the apparent double layer capacitance, which would then affect the accuracy of the hydrogen adsorption peak integration. It is important to avoid HER in the CV scans used for area measurements because the H<sub>2</sub> produced may remain on the electrode surface, therefore affecting the measurements by affecting the contact area of the electrolyte. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### HER Kinetics\n",
    "The Tafel slope signifies the overpotential required to pass an additional order of magnitude of current. The Tafel slope for the Pt electrode shown in Figure 5 displayed a clear dependence on potential, where higher (magnitude) potentials led to a larger Tafel slope and smaller potentials led to a smaller Tafel slope. This suggests that it becomes more difficult to produce H<sub>2</sub> at higher potentials compared to smaller potentials. The literature reports two regions on the Tafel plot for HER, where the Tafel slope will change from 36–68 mV/dec to 125 mV/dec at higher overpotentials in 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.<cite id=\"0m7tt\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FNCFT5K9A\"><sup>14</sup></a></cite> The measured values for the Tafel slope shown in Figure 5 were in agreement with these literature found values, although the higher overpotential Tafel slope was larger than the literature reported value, at 166 mV/dec. Literature values for the exchange current density of HER on Pt electrode surfaces range from 0.1 to 1 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is in agreement with the measured value.<cite id=\"tfts8\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FHCQ6YXDM\"><sup>15</sup></a></cite><cite id=\"0z7ho\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FUXRJGRWZ\"><sup>,16</sup></a></cite> The exchange current density for the Pt electrode was determined to be between 0.41 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> and 11.07 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, depending on where the Tafel slope was extracted. The Tafel slopes measured at lower (magnitude) overpotentials were closer to the literature Tafel slopes, and also produced exchange current densities closer to the literature reported exchange current densities. Typically, Tafel slopes are measured at overpotentials greater than ~120 mV as so the reverse-reaction current may be ignored. For this reason, the Tafel slope of 166 mV/dec and exchange current density of 11.07 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> may be taken as the most accurate set of values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to the Pt electrode, the Pt-black electrode displayed a smaller Tafel slope for both regions of the Tafel plot it was measured for. The smaller Tafel slope means that less overpotential is required to pass the same amount of current. Despite the smaller Tafel slopes, Pt-black also had a smaller exchange current density on average. This could mean that the cathodic half reaction is more favorable than the anodic half reaction for the Pt-black electrode, despite an overall smaller exchange current density. The difference in the measured Tafel slopes for the Pt and Pt-black electrodes is relatively small, suggesting that there may not be a significant difference between the two. The Cu electrode displayed a significantly smaller exchange current density than both Pt-type electrodes, at 0.0666 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. Further, the Cu electrode displayed a much larger Tafel slope of 339 mV/dec. Both of these results suggest Cu is a poor catalyst for HER. There were very few reports of Tafel slopes of Cu found in literature in the same conditions studied here so this result was not verified.<cite id=\"q47r4\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FTHBGWY9P\"><sup>17</sup></a></cite>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cu electrode displayed the widest potential window, due to the small exchange current density and the small amount of current being passed. With the small amount of current that was passed, there was only a very small ohmic loss allowing for nearly the entire range of potentials swept to be measured in the Tafel analysis. With the Pt and Pt-black electrodes, the ohmic loss was greater due to the higher current, thereby reducing the potential range that could be analyzed. The Cu electrode may have been swept further negative while still providing a usable potential window for Tafel kinetics, as there would not be a significant amount of hydrogen produced until far greater overpotentials.\n",

    "### 4.2 OER\n",
    "#### TOF Measurements\n",
    "The number of active catalyst sites was measured by integration of the NiOOH/Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub> redox waves at two different scan rates, 20 mV/s and 50 mV/s. The charge measured for the peak integration showed a dependence on scan rate, where the slower 20 mV/s scan produced summed charges roughly 0.03 mC larger than the 50 mV/s scan rate. This discrepancy may be attributed to the kinetics of the redox reaction. The slower scan rate yielded more charge because the species were given more chances to overcome to kinetic barrier of the reaction. The measured charges were also much smaller than what was reported in literature for a very similar procedure,<cite id=\"xrq7u\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FZA3KF2R3\"><sup>9</sup></a></cite> which might be attributed to exactly how the catalyst synthesis process was carried for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OER Kinetics\n",
    "The TOF was calculated using the current density at 300 mV overpotential, and found to be between 0.126 and 0.146 s<sup>-1</sup>. The values reported in literature ranged from 0.03 s<sup>-1</sup> to 0.4 s<sup>-1</sup> depending on the method of deposition of the catalyst layer,<cite id=\"xrq7u\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FZA3KF2R3\"><sup>9</sup></a></cite> which is in agreement with the value measured. The Tafel slope for OER was measured as 55 mV/dec, which is larger than the value found in literature, of 37 ± 3 mV/dec.<cite id=\"xrq7u\"><a href=\"#zotero%7C7738305%2FZA3KF2R3\"><sup>9</sup></a></cite> This difference may be attributed to the method of catalyst deposition, the efficiency at which O<sub>2</sub> was evacuated from the electrode surface, or the accuracy of the reference electrode. The method for which the Tafel slope was measured from literature also different from the method used in this report, being a series of chronopotentiometry steps rather than cyclic voltammetry experiments. The Tafel slope was also observed to change with potential, where at higher potentials the Tafel slope is larger. This may be because the measurements are not being taken while the system is a steady state, and therefore any time-dependance of the catalyst activity will be confounded with apparent potential dependance of catalyst activity. This argument would be more convincing if the OER current showed more signs of hysteresis during the reverse scan. Another possibility is that at higher potentials, more O<sub>2</sub> is being produced than can be evacuated from the catalyst sites, requiring additional overpotential to pass the same amount of current with fewer accessibly catalyst sites. Lastly, the shallower Tafel slope at smaller overpotentials may be a result of current still being passed from the oxidation of Ni(OH)<sub>2</sub>, although if this were true one would not expect the same behavior on the reverse scan as is observed in Figure 13. The decrease in available catalyst sites is the most probable explanation for this behavior.  \n"

      "abstract": "Bifunctional electrode and electrolytic cell configuration for electrochemical water splitting are reviewed.The different green energy systems powered water splitting are summarized and discussed.An outlook of future research prospects for the development of green energy system powered water splitting in practical application process is proposed., Hydrogen (H2) production is a latent feasibility of renewable clean energy. The industrial H2 production is obtained from reforming of natural gas, which consumes a large amount of nonrenewable energy and simultaneously produces greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Electrochemical water splitting is a promising approach for the H2 production, which is sustainable and pollution-free. Therefore, developing efficient and economic technologies for electrochemical water splitting has been an important goal for researchers around the world. The utilization of green energy systems to reduce overall energy consumption is more important for H2 production. Harvesting and converting energy from the environment by different green energy systems for water splitting can efficiently decrease the external power consumption. A variety of green energy systems for efficient producing H2, such as two-electrode electrolysis of water, water splitting driven by photoelectrode devices, solar cells, thermoelectric devices, triboelectric nanogenerator, pyroelectric device or electrochemical water–gas shift device, have been developed recently. In this review, some notable progress made in the different green energy cells for water splitting is discussed in detail. We hoped this review can guide people to pay more attention to the development of green energy system to generate pollution-free H2 energy, which will realize the whole process of H2 production with low cost, pollution-free and energy sustainability conversion.",

In recent years, the understanding of this hydrogen region has improved considerably: on Pt(111) sites, there is indeed only hydrogen adsorption, while on step sites, the hydrogen region involves the replacement of adsorbed hydrogen by adsorbed hydroxyl which interacts with co-adsorbed cations. However, the hydrogen region features an enigmatic and less well-understood “third hydrogen peak”, which develops on oxidatively roughened platinum electrodes as well as on platinum electrodes with a high (110) step density that have been subjected to a high concentration of hydrogen. In this paper, we present evidence that the peak involves surface-adsorbed hydrogen (instead of subsurface hydrogen) on a locally “reconstructed” (110)-type surface site. This site is unstable when the hydrogen is oxidatively removed. The cation sensitivity of the third hydrogen peak appears different from other step-related peaks, suggesting that the chemistry involved may still be subtly different from the other features in the hydrogen region.",

      "abstract": "Modulating metal oxides\n            \n              The more difficult step in fuel cells and water electrolysis is the oxygen evolution reaction. The search for earth-abundant materials to replace noble metals for this reaction often turns to oxides of three-dimensional metals such as iron. Zhang\n              et al.\n              show that the applied voltages needed to drive this reaction are reduced for iron-cobalt oxides by the addition of tungsten. The addition of tungsten favorably modulates the electronic structure of the oxyhydroxide. A key development is to keep the metals well mixed and avoid the formation of separate phases.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              333\n            \n          , \n            The addition of tungsten to iron cobalt oxides lowers the overpotential required for the evolution of oxygen from water.\n          , \n            Earth-abundant first-row (3d) transition metal–based catalysts have been developed for the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER); however, they operate at overpotentials substantially above thermodynamic requirements. Density functional theory suggested that non-3d high-valency metals such as tungsten can modulate 3d metal oxides, providing near-optimal adsorption energies for OER intermediates. We developed a room-temperature synthesis to produce gelled oxyhydroxides materials with an atomically homogeneous metal distribution. These gelled FeCoW oxyhydroxides exhibit the lowest overpotential (191 millivolts) reported at 10 milliamperes per square centimeter in alkaline electrolyte. The catalyst shows no evidence of degradation after more than 500 hours of operation. X-ray absorption and computational studies reveal a synergistic interplay between tungsten, iron, and cobalt in producing a favorable local coordination environment and electronic structure that enhance the energetics for OER.",
